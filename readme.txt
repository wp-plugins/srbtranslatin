SrbTransLatin is targeted to WP blogs written in Serbian language. It solves problem of two scripts equally used for Serbian language (Cyrillic and Latin) in the best possible manner: authors may enter posts and other information using Cyrillic script, but visitor may choose if he wants to read in Cyrillic or Latin script.

== Description ==

Site owner may set default script to show, by altering value of the var $sr2latin_default_language.

Script may be selected manually, by adding ?lang=cir or ?lang=lat to document url. If parameter is not specified default script is used. Initially, cyrillic script is set as default.

Site owner may use widget to allow visitors to choose among Cyrillic and Latin script. He may choose if script options are shown as html links or items of combo box. By default, html link are dipslayed. He also may set if widget would show title or not. Titles are hidden by default.

When user selects script, his choice stays permanent while he is on site. All internal links within site are altered to contain information about selected script. This means, when link is copied and pasted to some other site, it would contain information which script to use for displaying contents.

When transliteration occurs, everything in the HTML document is transliterated from Cyrillic to Latin script except if contents is placed among <lang id="skip"> and </lang> tags. This leaves user to mark part of the tehst he does not want to be transliterated at all, meaning, some parts of Cyrillic text may stay Cyrillic even if user chooses to view site in Latin script.

If some contents is entered in Latin script, it would stay in Latin even if user chooses to use Cyrillic. Transliteration occurs only from Cyrillic to Latin script.

Initially, when new article is posted using Cyrillic script in title, permalink is created with conversion to Latin script. Site owner may turn it of by setting variable $sr2latin_transliterate_title to true.

Transliteration works for all feeds too (atom, rdf, rss, rss2).



This plugin is developed inspired by two plugins WP Translit by Aleksandar Urošević and srlatin by Kimmo Suominen. I actually merged functionality of these two and expanded it with a lot of new functionality.

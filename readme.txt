SrbTransLatin handles using Serbian language Cyrillic and Latin script. For Cyrillic content, visitor may choose to view it using Cyrillic or Latin.

== Description ==

Contents of the site should be written using Cyrillic script. Then, this plugin will allow users to choose to read contents in Cyrollic or Latin script.

If some contents is entered in Latin script, it would stay in Latin even if user chooses to use Cyrillic. Transliteration occurs only from Cyrillic to Latin script.

Site owner may set default for script to show: 
- Cyrillic,
- Latin and
- Cyrillic if visitor accepts it (has set some Cyrillic language as acceptable in his browser)

Script also may be selected manually, by adding ?lang=cir or ?lang=lat to document url. If parameter is not specified default script is used.

Site owner may use widget to allow visitors to choose among Cyrillic and Latin script. He may choose if script options are shown as html links or items of combo box. By default, html link are dipslayed. He also may set if widget would show title or not.

When user selects script, his choice stays permanent while he is on site. All internal links within site are altered to contain information about selected script. This means, when link is copied and pasted to some other site, it would contain information which script to use for displaying contents. There is an option to remember choosen script as cookie in visitor's brower so he has no need to set it again on future visits.

When transliteration occurs, everything in the HTML document is transliterated from Cyrillic to Latin script except if contents is placed among [lang id="skip"] and [/lang] tags. This leaves user to mark part of the text he does not want to be transliterated at all, meaning, some parts of Cyrillic text may stay Cyrillic even if user chooses to view site in Latin script.

Initially, when new article is posted using Cyrillic script in title, permalink is created with conversion to Latin script. Site owner may turn it of.

Transliteration works for all feeds too (atom, rdf, rss, rss2).


Using script selector on custom places

If you need to put script selector in site template outside widgets areas then you can use function stl_show_selector() provided with plugin. Function accepts two parameters:

stl_show_selector (selector_type, oneline_separator)

selector_type chooses which type of selector to display: 
  links - list of choices in form of widget items
	oneline - list of script choices as one line separated by oneline_separator

To use this function just call it from place where you need code to be inserted, like:

<?php stl_show_selector('oneline', '/') ?>


This plugin is developed inspired by two plugins WP Translit by Aleksandar Urošević and srlatin by Kimmo Suominen. I actually merged functionality of these two and expanded it with a lot of new functionality I needed for my site.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can this transliterate my blog which uses Serbian Latin script into Serbian Cyrillic?

No. Such conversion is hard if imposible due to not unique transliteration rules. It is recomended that you create  contents on your site using Cyrillic script if you need both scripts.


= This is really nice script which I use on my site. Can I donate some money to author?

No. This is free to use script. If you want to show appreciation, spread the work, share the link to http://pedja.supurovic.net/projekti/srbtranslatin
